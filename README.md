![IMG](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/An0n3m0us/doorsplus/master/.doors.gif)

A Minetest mod that improves the default doors mod and other doors mods.

## Additions

### New door model

Default door and trapdoor models with a nicer model.

Doesn't work with some texturepacks that override doors and trapdoors.

Credit to [benrob0329](https://github.com/benrob0329) and [DS-Minetest](https://github.com/DS-Minetest) for optimizing the door model.

### Trapdoor front and back texture

The trapdoors can have a different back and front texture using `doors_trapdoor_back.png` and `doors_trapdoor_steel_back.png`
